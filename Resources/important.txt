Correct. In Spring Boot, if you use @RequestMapping("/api/blahblah") at the class level
and @GetMapping("/blah/") at the method level, the endpoint will match /api/blahblah/blah/
but not /api/blahblah/blah (without the trailing slash).

To make the endpoint accessible with or without the trailing slash, use @GetMapping("/blah")
 (no trailing slash) or just @GetMapping("blah").
 Spring will then match both /api/blahblah/blah and /api/blahblah/blah/.
