here inside this file i will document whatever i did until now

1) create project with spring initializer with all needed dependencies

2) now creating different dbs for different profile with different credentials

queries:
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS test;
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS production;
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS development;

    -- Create user for test database
    CREATE USER 'test_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '171225';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO 'test_user'@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    -- Create user for production database
    CREATE USER 'prod_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '171225';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON production.* TO 'prod_user'@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    -- Create user for development database
    CREATE USER 'dev_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '171225';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON development.* TO 'dev_user'@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

3) create and test different profile for test production and development

4) create model in base package and write all table entities inside that with specifications as below

    A. Customer

        Long id
        String name
        String email
        String phone
        LocalDate membershipDate
        Boolean isFeePaid

    B. Book :

        Long id
        String title
        String author
        int totalCopies
        int availableCopies
        List<Review> reviews (OneToMany)

    C. IssuedBook :

        Long id
        Book book (ManyToOne)
        Customer customer (ManyToOne)
        LocalDate issueDate
        LocalDate dueDate
        LocalDate returnDate
        Boolean isReturned
        Double fineAmount

    D. Review :

        Long id
        Book book (ManyToOne)
        Customer customer (ManyToOne)
        String content
        int rating (1â€“5)

    E.Payment :

        Long id
        Customer customer (ManyToOne)
        LocalDate paymentDate
        Double amount
        Boolean isSuccessful

5) if you want to provide some generated values, you need to alter that table accordingly inside mysql db
